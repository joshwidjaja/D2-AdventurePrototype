A simple adventure game by Josh Widjaja based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Desktop, Folder, Bridge, FourKings
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Intro, Error, Outro
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: Added a 'Folder' button to the interface - it will take the player to and from the 'Game Folder' scene at any point in the game. 
    - Enhancement 2: Added a global variable to keep track of the last scene visited before Folder (outerSceneKey).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: Desktop, Folder, Bridge, Castle 1F and 2F
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: Brian, Soy Sauce, Samurai
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: Most ingame objects
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: Most ingame objects, except for non-renameable files
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: Soy sauce object 'flees' on pointerover

Asset sources:
- RPG Maker 2000 RTP provided some sprites and sound files.
    - I removed the sprites' backgrounds in krita.
- [VIPRPG Resource Storage](https://w.atwiki.jp/viprpg_sozai/) contained voiced audio assets.
- [OpenClipart-Vectors](https://pixabay.com/vectors/asian-bottle-chinese-cuisine-food-1294266/)

Code sources:
- `adventure.js` and `index.html` were created for this project by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and edited by me.
- `game.js` was sketched by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and rewritten by me.
