A simple adventure game by Josh Widjaja based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Desktop, Folder, Bridge, FourKings
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Intro, Error, Outro
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: Added a 'Folder' button to the interface - it will take the player to and from the 'Game Folder' scene at any point in the game. 
    - Enhancement 2: Added a global variable to keep track of the last scene visited before Folder (outerSceneKey).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: unsatisfied (name at least 4 of the classes).
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: Brian, Soy Sauce, Samurai
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: Most ingame objects
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: Most ingame objects, except for non-renameable files
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
